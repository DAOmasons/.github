## About
### Our Mission is to help DAOs win.
Because when DAOs win, we all win!
It's that simple. We believe in the massive potential of DAOs and we're working to help them win, however we can.

## What We Do

### DAO Design

We start with your idea, existing organization or DAO. DAO Masons will design a functional DAO with a governance surface that helps you make decisions, coordinate, and grow. We gather input from your team and community. We help you define your mission, vision, and values and the mechanisms that help you stay aligned and moving toward meaningful outcomes.

### DAO Operations

Does your DAO need some extra hands on deck? Bring in a team of DAO Masons to help you with your operations. We can help you with everything from onboarding new members to writing documentation.
Development

DAOs are unique. DAO Masons will craft custom DAO applications and tools for your DAO based on your unique needs. Our aim is to help your team focus on what matters most: the mission.

### Education

We provide workshops and cohorts to turn every member into a power-user. In order for governance to be accessible to all members, they need know what game they are playing, and how to play it well.

### Products

Our goal is to maximize the value we create for the DAO ecosystem so we refactor some of our custom service solutions into scalable, modular products accessible to everyone.

## How to Contribute
Are you...

a highly motivated, passionate DAO builder, designer, connector and/or operator? We're looking for you!

We have two distinct membership paths for contributors to work with DAO Masons.

### Contributor Member Track

The Contributor Member Track is a low-friction track, designed to get hard-working, talented builders working on DAO Masons projects as fast as possible. It is also for those who would like to one day become a Core Member and are looking to demonstrate their skills and commitment to DAO Masons.

There are no limitations on earnings or how many projects a Contributor Member can work on. The key distinction between Contributor Members and Core Members is that Contributors have no commitments or authority related to DAO Masons governance while Core Members have both.

If you wish to begin working as a DAO Mason, please join our Discord and introduce yourself in the #introductions channel. Be sure to let us know your skill set and why DAO Masons appeals to you.

When we have project work available that is a match for you, you may be recruited by a Project Lead to join a project team.

### Core Member Track

Governance requires frequent, consistent, and dedicated participation. The Core Member Track is designed for those who are committed and determined to make DAO Masons as successful as possible.

In order to meet the demands of DAO governance (which are frequently underestimated), the Core Member Track is designed to be high-friction. We want to filter in those who are willing to take on the responsibilities and challenges of DAO governance. Not only must you be a talented builder, but you must also be a talented communicator, critical-thinker, and leader.

However, it is important to note that anyone willing to put in the effort can become a Core Member. We will never gate based on how much money you have or how many connections you have.

This path is difficult but it is designed to be as fair as possible.
